#' Build a data frame containing interest rates for CDS pricing
#' 
#' \code{build_rates} can create a data frame of interest rates from a start 
#' date to an end date, which are specified by the user. The interest rates will
#' be later used in CDS pricing. \code{build_rates} also builds the rates.RData 
#' in the package. \code{build_rates} mainly consists \code{download_markit} and
#' \code{download_FRED}. The two sources are Markit website and FRED website.
#' 
#' @param start.date is the start date of the data frame; it is the earliest CDS
#'   pricing date that the user concerns.
#' @param end.date is the end date of the data frame; it is the lastest CDS 
#'   pricing date that the user concerns.
#'   
#' @return a data frame that contains the CDS pricing date, the currency, the 
#'   interest rate expiry and the interest rate.
#'   
#' @details
#' since Markit wesite has the interest rates back to th 1990s, download_markit 
#' is responsible for building up all the USD interest rate data frame; for EUR 
#' and JPY, markit can only get from 2005-01-05 to now. But the biggest 
#' advantage of using download_markit is that, since Markit website only lists 
#' the rate expiries that are actually used for CDS pricing, download_markit can
#' get the exact type of expiries of rates needed to price CDS. Also, it has 
#' expiry over 1Y to 30Y. In contrast, FRED is only complementary to markit 
#' data. Since download_markit can get any rates for USD, we don't use FRED for 
#' USD. Then we want to get data for EUR and JPY before 2005-01-04 (the limit of
#' markit). FRED has almost all data for any date, which is its biggest 
#' advantage. But its biggest disadvantage is that it doesn't know which expiry 
#' type is suitable for which time, since FRED website has expiry of all types 
#' below a year; also it doesn't have expiry over 1Y.So we hardcoded the dates 
#' below, to combine markit and FRED in the most suitable way.
#' 
#' Another note is that, the rates on both Markit website and FRED website have 
#' not been adjusted to the previous business day. In other words, the rates 
#' from both website is the exact rate on that day, rather than on the previous 
#' business day. But download_markit and download_FRED have adjusted the days 
#' already for the convenience of CDS pricing, so we don't have to worry here.
